    <<~EOS
      sim requires WebDriverAgent (WDA) for tap/swipe commands.
      One-time setup (run once per machine):

        git clone https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent /tmp/WebDriverAgent

      Then start a session before using tap/swipe:

        sim --device <UDID> setup <bundle_id_or_app_path>

      To install bundled Claude Code skills (qa-branch and others):

        sim install-skills

      This copies skills to ~/.claude/skills/ making them available in any
      Claude Code session immediately.
